**By: Dreamscale Cui Et Al**

**Year: 2020**

Welcome! First we have congratulations in order.. Why you ask, for discovering a universal peer to peer hyperspace terminal emulated in javascript. What, me? Yes, you! You are special and brillant, and please before we get started take a deep breathe and become aware that you are finally here, right now... So Now lets continute:

This hyperspace terminal is design to allow users to create and publish messages into other universes through quantum entanglement. The terminal also allows  you  to subscribe to messages from  the other universes connected to this hyperspace, again using quantum entanglement. This terminal is also capable of working offline  to the StarTalk network. Which will be able to use the same great  features,   but only locally.

Once running on your machine, access the shell by pressing meta key (or control) + ~ (tilda) key. This can be changed by editing the settings.json file within  your ~/.flow directory.

the shell will  slide   down from the top of your screen, and a left sidepanel is used for navigation within the network. clicking on a team member will display  their hyperspace journal for all universes to see. If at anytime you encounter a  problem or have no  clue what     the fuck is actually going on here;  please click the lightening bolt  on the bottom left part of the console shell... This will   begin a new troubleshooting session and help you debug  your AI's nueral net.. sounds fun but its not.

the main part of the  shell contains the terminal browser content.. All content, circuits, terminals, chat rooms, games, apps, or any multi-media content  or stream is represented by a unique number and   URI path such as /terminal or just typing terminal. Not unlike a typical hyperweb browser, you have the same safety blanket  of chome dev tools w/ realtime compiling.. O yes o yes, a compiler compiled inside a compiler, realtime.

thank you. and  enjoy.

good luck,
have fun~!
