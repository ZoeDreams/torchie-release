### INSTALLATION ###

1) Grab the RELEASE .dmg, mount, and install. 

2) Email accounts@dreamscale.io with your name and organization. Please be sure to included your intentions or dreams about what you will use this invention for. After authorization, you will be emailed a reply with your 'Activation Token'.

3) Please  patiently wait until you recieve your 'Activation Token'. *This token is sacred*, and has been uniquely assigned to you before we have begun. Do not share this token, as it is used to define whom you are in this other realm. In case you lose this token, or if the token is stolen contact lost@dreamscale.io

4) Once you have  recieved this activation token, enter it into the Torchie activation window. The application will do a some  really complicated math things and maybe some networking database things too. After some time it will continue along with the loading process of the shell. 

5) Once running on your machine, access the shell by pressing meta key (or control) + ~ (tilda) key. This can be changed by editing the settings.json file within  your home/.flow directory.

thank you. and  enjoy.

good luck,
have fun~!
